## Summary
This data visualization shows the trend of the mean batting average batting against the height of baseball players. In this chart, the x coordinate of a point stands for a height, and the y coordinate stand for the mean batting average of players of that height. Players of different handedness are denoted by the color of the point. The trend is clear that shorter players tend to have higher batting average, except very tall players.


## Design
I choose to make a scatterplot because I want to show this two-variable elationship. It is easy for readers to figure out what the height and mean batting average are for each point on the chart and tell the trend across different height values. I use colors to encode handedness. Given there are only 3 options, the color encoding is not confusing readers and easy to distinguish. I also put the legend to the right top corner which is easy to find.
