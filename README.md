## Summary
This data visualization shows how the number of home runs varies across players with different weights and batting averages. In this chart, the coordinates of a bubble stand for a player's weight and batting average, while the size of the bubble shows his/her number of home runs. The chart shows that players with higher batting averages tend to have more home runs. It also shows that players with higher weights tend to have more home runs.
